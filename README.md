# Handwritten MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a simple approach to classifying handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**. The model uses **Logistic Regression** to detect whether a given image corresponds to the digit "2" or not. The dataset is preloaded using **Scikit-learn's fetch_openml** API, and we perform basic data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using cross-validation.


## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… **MNIST Dataset**: Loaded from OpenML with 70,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- âœ… **Binary Classifier**: The model is trained to detect the digit "2".
- âœ… **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by shuffling.
- âœ… **Logistic Regression**: Using **Scikit-learn** to train a Logistic Regression model for digit classification.
- âœ… **Cross-Validation**: Evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation with accuracy scoring.


## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- âœ… **Python** â€“ Programming language used for analysis.
- âœ… **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning library used for model creation, evaluation, and cross-validation.
- âœ… **Matplotlib** â€“ Used to visualize a sample image from the MNIST dataset.
- âœ… **NumPy** â€“ For numerical operations and data manipulation.
